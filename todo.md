* goal is to read data first each excel spreadsheet and csv
* read in pnadas first then do it in pyspark
* identify which dataframes have common columns and join them using sql statements
* we use pyspark for preprocessing the data to make sql queries
* once data is joined we do exploratory data analysis and feature engineering
* visualize the data using powerbi or something
* use box plot to see interquartile ranges (get it from data-mining-hw repo)
